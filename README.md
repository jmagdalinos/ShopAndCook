# ShopAndCook
## Introduction
Shop&Cook is an app originally developed for Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, namely as the Capstone Project. It allows a user to create a Week's plan of meals which can then be used to produce a week's shopping list. The user can store recipes, meals, shopping list items and (in the paid version) access food2fork's api to search for new recipe ideas.

## Apis used
The paid version of the app enables the search for recipes using keywords with the food2fork api.

## Services and Libraries used
To enable shared content across devices, Firebase' Realtime Databased was used along with Firebase Authentication. Firebase Remote Config was used to store the api key for the food2fork api. Google services AdMob was used for adding ads and Picasso for caching images from the food2fork api.
